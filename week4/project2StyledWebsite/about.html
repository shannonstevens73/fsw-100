            My name is Shannon Stevens, and I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science, and am currently taking additional college classes in Web Development. I have been around computers most of my life. My dad was interested in computers, and I guess that is where my fondness for computers comes from. Web development is very creative, and as an aspiring artist, I enjoy that aspect of it. <br><br> On the above navbar you will also find links to my Artwork page and Blog page.

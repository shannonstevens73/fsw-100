                My name is Shannon Stevens, and I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am passionate about books and reading. Literacy and the education of every American is vital, if we are going to have a free and equal society. Kat's bookshop is my tiny contribution to the world of books. If you are ever in the area, please stop by for some coffee and conversation - and for the books. You will find a wide variety  of non-fiction and fiction, old and new books. Peruse our used book section to find some hidden gems. <br> <br> I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science, and am currently taking additional college classes in Web Development. I have been around computers most of my life. My dad was interested in computers, and I guess that is where my fondness for computers comes from. Web development is very creative, and as an aspiring artist, I enjoy that aspect of it.
